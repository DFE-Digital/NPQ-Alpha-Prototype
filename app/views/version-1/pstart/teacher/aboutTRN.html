    <p>If you don’t know what your teacher reference number (TRN) is, this can usually be found on your payslip, teachers’ pension documentation or teacher training records.</p>

    <p>The TRN is typically seven digits long, but previously has been known as a QTS, GTC, DfE, DfES or DCSF number and therefore may include the letters RP and the forward slash symbol ‘/’. For example: 4567814 or 95/78674</p>

    <p>If you cannot find your TRN, you can request a reminder.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Request a TRN reminder by email</h2>
    <p>Send an email <a href="">qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk</a> which includes your:</p>
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>full name</li>
            <li>date of birth</li>
             <li>National Insurance number</li>
        </ul>
      

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Request a TRN reminder by phone</h2>
         <p>Call the Teaching Regulation Agency on 020 7593 5394<br />Make sure you have your National Insurance number ready before you call.</p>
