  <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl" >Try the Apply journey</h1>

      
    <p>This is a test environment which lets you experience the Apply service as a candidate, training provider or software vendor.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
   
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>sign in as an candidate and apply for training</li>
            <li>sign in as a training provider and process an applicant</li>
             <li>test the system’s API capabilities</li>
        </ul>

<p>You can give us feedback at any time to help us improve the service</p>
      
 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get started</h2>
<p> Apply allows you to integrate your software with ours and test it.
It also lets you process dummy applications to test as a training provider.</p>

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Apply - what’s it about</h2>
         <p>Apply replaces the online UCAS application system for postgraduate teacher training</p>
         <p>All vendors of student record systems and some training providers must make changes to integrate with Apply.</p>
         <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How is it used</h2>
         <p>When Apply receives an application, it can then be seen by others</p>
        <p>Providers can then use it to:</p>
               <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>retrieve applications</li>
            <li>make a candidate an offer</li>
             <li>Confirm a candidate’s  suitability</li>
             <li> reject an application </li>
        </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How do I connect to Apply</h2>
          <p>Any request needs validating by an authentication token.</p>
          <p>A token is created by a provider. It grants access to applications made by that provider.
</p>
<p>Get a token by emailing <a href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.</a></p>
<p>To activate a token, see the <a href="#">Apply reference.</a></p>
