<p>Some providers may have specific criteria depending on your school’s circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, the provider may require your school to be rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ if you wish to train for their NPQ.
Check with your current school to see if they recommended accredited partners for NPQ training.</p>
