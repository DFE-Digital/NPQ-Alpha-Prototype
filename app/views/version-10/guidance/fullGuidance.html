<!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" >Available courses</h2> -->
<p>National professional qualifications (NPQs) are a national, voluntary suite of qualifications,designed to support the professional development of teachers and leaders.</p>

<div class="callToAction">
<p>Anyone currently undertaking an NPQ under the existing contracts and frameworks will continue to benefit from the knowledge and skills gained from these courses. All current participants are required to complete these courses, including assessment and moderation, by August 2022. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/professional-development-for-school-leaders">For more information about the existing NPQs</a> and current participants see Professional development for school leaders</p>
</div>


 <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="reformed" >Reformed national professional qualifications</h2>
<p>From September 2021, a reformed suite of NPQs will be available for teachers and leaders who want to develop their knowledge and skills in school leadership and specialist areas of teaching practice. These reforms include:</p>

<p>These changes include:</p>
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>reforming the 3 existing NPQs in senior leadership, headship and executive leadership to ensure that they are underpinned by the latest and best evidence of what works</li>
            <li>replacing the current NPQ in middle leadership with 3 new NPQs for teachers and leaders who want to develop their expertise in specialist areas of teaching practice:</li>
           
        </ul>

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="NPQs">NPQs available from 2021 </h2>
   <p>The 3 new NPQs in specialist areas of teaching are:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>leading teacher development: for teachers supporting the training and development of others</li>
            <li>leading teaching: developing teachers who are subject leads or responsible for improving teaching practice in a subject or phase</li>
            <li>leading behaviour and culture: developing teachers who have responsibilities for leading behaviour and culture</li>
        </ul> 
    <p>The reformed leadership NPQs are:</p> 
     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>senior leadership: for school leaders who are, or are aspiring to be, a senior leader with cross-school responsibilities</li>
            <li>headship: for school leaders </li>
            <li>who are, or are aspiring to be, a headteacher or head of school with responsibility for leading a school executive leadership: for school leaders who are, or are aspiring to be, an executive headteacher or have a school trust CEO role with responsibility for leading several schools</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>On 13 October 2020, we published new content frameworks which underpin each of these NPQs. These frameworks set out the things that participants should know and be able to do after completing an NPQ, and providers have used these to design their courses. </p>
        <p>You can access the reformed content <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-frameworks-from-september-2021">national professional qualification frameworks: from September 2021</a></p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="whats" >What’s involved</h2>
<p>NPQs provide teachers and leaders with the training, support and guidance they need to develop expertise in school leadership and specialist areas of teaching practice. </p>
<p>They have been designed with teachers and leaders in mind using the latest evidence and can be completed flexibly around existing commitments. </p>
<p>Study can last between 2 academic terms and 18 months, depending on your chosen NPQ and provider, who will also determine the course’s structure, content and method of delivery.  </p>
<p>During this time you will: </p>
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>learn from the evidence-based curriculum of your chosen qualification, drawing on effective pedagogy, current research and international best practice. This will equip you with the knowledge and skills to either improve in your current role, or take the next step in your career. </li>
    <li>partake in a mixture face-to-face sessions, webinars, and self-directed study. </li>
    <li>answer a short, assessed case study question (the summative assessment).</li>
 </ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="additional" >Additional support offer for the NPQH</h2>
<p>In addition to the reformed suite of National Professional Qualifications, the department is introducing an additional support offer for new head teachers from September 2021. This is a targeted support package for teachers new to the role of headship.</p>

</ul>
<p>The offer provides structured, unassessed face-to-face support based on the best available evidence about what makes an effective head teacher. Activities may include a combination of group coaching, one-to-one support discussions and peer network support.  </p>
