<!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" >Available courses</h2> -->
<p>National professional qualifications (NPQs) are a national, voluntary suite of qualifications,designed to support the professional development of teachers and leaders.</p>

<div class="callToAction">
<p>Anyone currently undertaking an NPQ under the existing contracts and frameworks will continue to benefit from the knowledge and skills gained from these courses. All current participants are required to complete these courses, including assessment and moderation, by August 2022. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/professional-development-for-school-leaders">For more information about the existing NPQs</a> and current participants see Professional development for school leaders</p>
</div>


 <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="reformed" >Reformed national professional qualifications</h2>
<p>From Autumn 2021, a reformed suite of NPQs will be available for teachers and leaders who want to develop their knowledge and skills in school leadership and specialist areas of teaching practice. These reforms include:</p>

<p>These changes include:</p>
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>reforming the 3 existing NPQs in senior leadership, headship and executive leadership</li>
            <li>replacing the current NPQ in middle leadership with 3 new NPQs for teachers and leaders who want to develop their expertise in specialist areas of teaching practice</li>
           
        </ul>




<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="whats" >What’s involved</h2>
<p>The specialist and leadership NPQs provide training and support for teachers and school leaders at all levels, from those who want to develop expertise in high quality teaching practice, such as behaviour management, to those leading multiple schools across trusts. </p>
<p>They are part of a wider set of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reforms-to-teacher-development">teacher development</a> reforms which together will create a ‘golden thread’ of high-quality evidence underpinning the support, training and development available through the entirety of a teacher’s career. </p>
<p>NPQs have been designed with teachers and leaders in mind using the latest evidence and can be completed flexibly around existing commitments.</p>

<p>Study can last between 2 academic terms and 18 months, depending on your chosen NPQ and provider, who will also determine the course structure, content and method of delivery.  </p>


<p>During this period of study you will: </p>
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>learn from the evidence-based curriculum of your chosen qualification, drawing on effective pedagogy, current research and international best practice. This will equip you with the knowledge and skills to either improve in your current role, or take the next step in your career.</li>
    <li>partake in a mixture face-to-face sessions, webinars, and self-directed study. </li>
    <li>answer a short, assessed case study question (the summative assessment).</li>

 </ul>

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="NPQs">NPQs available from September 2021 </h2>
   <p>The 3 new NPQs in specialist areas of teaching are:</p>

        </ul>
