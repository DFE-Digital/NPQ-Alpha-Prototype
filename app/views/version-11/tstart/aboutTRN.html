    <p>If you don’t know what your teacher reference number (TRN) is, you can find this on your payslip, teachers’ pensions documentation or teacher training records.</p>

    <p>The TRN is typically seven digits long, but previously has been known as a QTS, GTC, DfE, DfES or DCSF number and therefore may include the letters RP and the forward slash symbol ‘/’. For example: 4567814 or 95/78674</p>

  <!--   <p>If you cannot find your TRN, you can request a reminder.</p> -->
